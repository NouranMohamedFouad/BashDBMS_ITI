# 🖥️ Bash Shell Script Database Management System (DBMS) 🚀  

## 📌 Project Overview  
Welcome to the **Bash Shell Script Database Management System (DBMS)**! This is a **command-line interface (CLI) based** database system built using Bash scripting. It allows users to **create, manage, and interact with databases** stored on a hard disk—**no external database engines required!**  

This project was developed by **Youssef Medhat** and **Nouran Mohamed** to provide a lightweight yet functional DBMS experience using pure Bash scripting.
